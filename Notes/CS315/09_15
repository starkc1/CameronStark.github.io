The -Procedural- paradigm views computation as -Observable Transformation between some initial memory state to some final memory state- and achieves this through -Incremental modifications to memory-.

The -Object Oriented- paradigm views computation as -Observable Transformation of some collection of objects from initial to final state- and achieves this through -Interaction among objects-.

The -Functional- paradigm views computation as -Observable Transformation between some input value to some output value- and achieves this through -Function Composition f(g(h(x)))-.



Procedural
    AddList
        input: L[n]
        output: sum

        sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        {
            sum = sum + L[i];
        }
        print sum;

Functional
    AddList
        input: L[n]
        output: sum

        sum(L[n]){
            if (n = 0)
            {
                return 0;
            }
            else 
            {
                return L[0] + Sum(L[n+1]);
            }
