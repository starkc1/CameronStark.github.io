My name is Cameron Stark, I have a passion for coding, programming and developing that are started to doing just that while I was in middle school over five years ago, where I developed several games for the Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone 8.1 using the program Game Maker by YoYo Games, with these games I learned the development process for both behind the scenes and for the user interface, which was outlined by the Windows Store application submission process. In making these games I created a Developer account, or as I call it “My company”, where I created many other applications using the Windows AppStudio program to created Windows Platform apps. I kept developing for this “Company” for the next four years, however it wasn’t until recently that are started to actually do the coding with C#, Python and MatLab to create applications. Currently I am working on two applications for the UWP(Universal Windows Platform) which can be seen on my portfolio. I enjoy programming and treat it like a puzzle where I create the pieces, while trying to find out how they create a unified project. I am currently learning Python and Ruby, while also going to school at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University for Software Engineering.
