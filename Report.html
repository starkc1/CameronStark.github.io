<h5>
    Week of December 25th - December 31st
</h5>
<p>
    Time Spent: 15.28 hrs
</p>
<p>
    A.) Accomplished setting up controllers for the three JSON urls and formatted them in a single page website
</p>
<p>
    B.) Learned routing and how they can be used with various controllers to create a website
</p>
<p>
    C.) I found that getting the routing and the ng-view to get working was difficult and passing a value from view to a controller
</p>
<p>
    D.) I enjoyed setting up the whole thing because the final effect of it is rather cool and interesting
